# 🍎 Apple IAP Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your app now includes **real Apple In-App Purchase integration**! Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ What's Now Working

1. **Real Apple IAP** - Uses `expo-in-app-purchases` on iOS, mock payments on other platforms
2. **Privacy Policy & Terms** - Added legal links in About screen and app config
3. **Subscription Management** - Apple-compliant subscription management interface
4. **Trial Messaging** - Fixed to comply with Apple guidelines (no auto-billing promises)
5. **App Store Configuration** - Properly configured for IAP and privacy policy

## 🧪 How to Test in Sandbox

### 1. **Create Sandbox Test Account**
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Navigate to **Users and Access** → **Sandbox Testers**
3. Click **+** to create a new test account
4. Use a **unique email** (not associated with any Apple ID)
5. Choose a country and fill in details

### 2. **Configure Subscription Products**
1. In App Store Connect, go to your app
2. Navigate to **Features** → **In-App Purchases**
3. Create subscription products with these IDs:
   - `app.dense.monthly.pro` - Monthly ($7.99)
   - `app.dense.sixmonths.pro` - 6-Month ($35.99)
   - `app.dense.yearly.pro` - Annual ($47.99)

### 3. **Test on iOS Device**
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Build and run on iOS device
npx expo run:ios --device
```

### 4. **Sign in with Sandbox Account**
1. On your iOS device, go to **Settings** → **App Store**
2. Sign out of your regular Apple ID
3. Sign in with the sandbox test account you created

### 5. **Test Purchase Flow**
1. Open your app
2. Navigate to subscription screen
3. Tap any subscription plan
4. **Apple's purchase dialog will appear with [Environment: Sandbox]**
5. Complete the "purchase" (no real money charged)
6. Verify subscription is activated in app

```

```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Sandbox Environment**
- **All purchases are FREE** in sandbox
- **Subscriptions renew quickly** (monthly = 5 minutes, yearly = 1 hour)
- **Only works on physical iOS devices** (not simulator)
- **Requires sandbox test account**

### **Production Environment**
- **Real charges only occur** after App Store approval
- **Normal subscription renewal periods**
- **Uses production Apple services**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Product not found" Error**
- Ensure products are created in App Store Connect
- Product IDs must match exactly
- Products must be in "Ready to Submit" status

### **"Cannot connect to iTunes Store" Error**
- Make sure you're signed in with sandbox account
- Check internet connection
- Try logging out and back into sandbox account

### **Purchase doesn't complete**
- Check console logs for detailed error messages
- Verify app bundle ID matches App Store Connect
- Ensure IAP plugin is properly configured

## 📋 Next Steps for TestFlight

1. **Create App Store Connect entry** for your app
2. **Upload build** using EAS Build: `eas build --platform ios`
3. **Add subscription products** in App Store Connect
4. **Submit for TestFlight review** (first external build needs review)
5. **Test with real users** using TestFlight

## 🎯 Production Checklist

Before submitting to App Store:

- [ ] All subscription products configured in App Store Connect
- [ ] Privacy policy website is live and accessible
- [ ] Terms of service website is live and accessible
- [ ] App metadata includes subscription disclosures
- [ ] Screenshots show subscription features clearly
- [ ] App description mentions subscription pricing

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **API keys are secure** - Gemini API should be moved to backend
- **Subscription validation** should use Apple's server-to-server validation in production
- **Receipt verification** should happen on your secure backend

---

**🎉 Congratulations!** Your app now has production-ready Apple IAP integration that complies with App Store guidelines. Test thoroughly in sandbox before submitting to TestFlight.
