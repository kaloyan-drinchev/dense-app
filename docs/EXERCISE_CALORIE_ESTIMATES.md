# Exercise Calorie Burn Estimates

This document provides approximate calorie burn estimates for all exercises that can be generated by the DENSE AI Program Generator.

## Notes

- Estimates are based on MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) values
- Values assume a **70kg (154lb) person** performing moderate intensity sets
- Calories scale with body weight (heavier people burn more)
- Includes rest time between sets (60-90 seconds)
- Actual calories vary based on:
  - Individual metabolism
  - Intensity/weight lifted
  - Rest periods
  - Form and efficiency

- Calf Raises: **1.5 cal/set** - Lowest calorie burn

## Typical Workout Calorie Estimates

### Push Day (4-5 exercises, 3 sets each)

- **Estimated Total: 80-120 calories**
- Example: Bench Press (3×8) + Shoulder Press (3×6) + Tricep Dips (3×5) + Lateral Raises (3×2) = ~90 calories

### Pull Day (4-5 exercises, 3 sets each)

- **Estimated Total: 90-130 calories**
- Example: Deadlift (3×12) + Pull-ups (3×8) + Rows (3×7.5) + Bicep Curls (3×2.5) = ~90 calories

### Leg Day (4-5 exercises, 3 sets each)

- **Estimated Total: 100-140 calories**
- Example: Back Squat (3×10) + Romanian Deadlift (3×8) + Leg Press (3×5.5) + Leg Curls (3×2.5) = ~78 calories

### Full Workout (60-90 minutes)

- **Estimated Total: 200-400 calories**
- Includes warm-up, rest periods, and all exercises

## Weight Adjustment Formula

Calories scale linearly with body weight:

```
Adjusted Calories = Base Calories × (Your Weight in kg / 70)
```

**Examples:**

- 60kg person: Multiply by 0.86
- 80kg person: Multiply by 1.14
- 90kg person: Multiply by 1.29

## Important Considerations

1. **EPOC (Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption)**: After heavy lifting, your body continues burning calories at an elevated rate for hours. This "afterburn" effect can add 10-20% to total calories.

2. **Muscle Building**: While lifting burns calories, building muscle increases your resting metabolic rate long-term.

3. **Intensity Matters**: Heavier weights and shorter rest periods increase calorie burn significantly.

4. **Individual Variation**: These are estimates. Actual calories vary based on:
   - Fitness level
   - Muscle mass
   - Age
   - Hormones
   - Genetics

## Summary by Exercise Type

| Exercise Type                    | Avg Calories/Set | Notes                           |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Heavy Compound (Deadlift, Squat) | 10-12            | Full body, maximum calorie burn |
| Medium Compound (Bench, Rows)    | 6-8              | Multiple muscle groups          |
| Light Compound (Presses, Pulls)  | 4-6              | Moderate intensity              |
| Pump Work                        | 3-4              | High reps, shorter rest         |
| Isolation                        | 2-3              | Single muscle group             |
| Machine Isolation                | 1.5-2.5          | Lowest calorie burn             |
